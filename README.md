# Do BNNs Need To Be Fully Stochastic?

This repo contains the code for: **Mrinank Sharma, Sebastian Farquhar, Eric Nalisnick, Tom Rainforth**; Proceedings of The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, PMLR 206:7694-7722. Link here: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/sharma23a.html. The paper was accepted as an oral presentation.

The codebase for this project heavily reuses code from publically released projects. There is a seperate folder for each codebase in this folder. Each folder has an instructions file to reproduce the results and the plots from the paper :)
